## Step 1 - Zero and Few Shot Prompting

- Large language models (LLMs) are tuned to follow instructions and are trained on large amounts of data. Large-scale training makes these models capable of performing some tasks in a "zero-shot" manner. 

 - Zero-shot prompting means that the prompt used to interact with the model won't contain examples or demonstrations. The zero-shot prompt directly instructs the model to perform a task without any additional examples to steer it.

- Let's try the following zero-shot prompt to generate a Blazor Server application

    ```
    Create a Blazor Server application that displays ten greatest hits from the 80s on the home page. Provide detailed code and commands
    ```

- Note that the prompt is short and does not contain any examples. The following is part of an example output:

    ```sh
    dotnet new blazorserver -o GreatestHitsApp
    cd GreatestHitsApp
    ```

    ```c#
    namespace GreatestHitsApp.Models
    {
        public class Song
        {
            public string Title { get; set; }
            public string Artist { get; set; }
            public int Year { get; set; }
        }
    }
    ```

- Your output might be slightly different

- While large-language models demonstrate remarkable zero-shot capabilities, they still fall short on more complex tasks when using the zero-shot setting. 

- Few-shot prompting can be used as a technique to enable in-context learning where we provide demonstrations in the prompt to steer the model to better performance. The demonstrations serve as conditioning for subsequent examples where we would like the model to generate a response.

- Let's try the following few-shot prompt to generate a Blazor Server application

     ```
    Create a Blazor Server application that displays ten songs on the home page. Provide detailed code and commands

    Examples:
    “Purple Rain” by Prince (1984)
    “Thriller” by Michael Jackson (1982)
    “Careless Whisper” by Wham! (1984)
    ```

- Note we provide some greatest hits from the 80s as examples

- The output should be similar to the zero-shot prompt, however Copilot is able to figure out the rest of the list based on the examples provided

- Standard few-shot prompting works well for many tasks containing simple repeated patterns but is still not a perfect technique, especially when dealing with more complex tasks, such as complex arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. For these tasks, we need to use more advanced prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting in the next section.

## Step 2 - Chain of Thought Method of Prompting

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. You can combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding.

- Using the same example as before, let's try the following chain-of-thought prompt to generate a Blazor Server application

    ```
    Let's create a Blazor Server application step by step that displays a list of songs

    Step 1: Create a new Blazor Server application
    Step 2: Create a model for songs
    Step 3: Create a service to get the list of greatest hit songs from 80s
    Step 4: Register the service in the main program
    Step 5: Create a component to display the list of songs
    Step 6: Update the navigation menu to include the new component
    ```

- The output should be similar to the few-shot prompt, however Copilot is able to generate the code in a more structured manner, where each code snippet corresponds to a step in the chain of thought

### Zero-Shot Chain of Thought

- For complex tasks that follow common patterns, you can simplify the chain of thought prompting above by using a single zero-shot prompt. Here is the simplified COT prompt for the same task

    ```
    Create a Blazor Server application that displays a list of greatest hits from the 80s
    Let's think step by step
    ```

- Copilot will first generate a step-by-step plan for creating the application and then generate the code for each step. The following is an example plan generated by Copilot

    ```
    1. Create a new Blazor Server project.
    2. Define a Song model.
    3. Create a SongService to manage the list of songs.
    4. Develop a Razor component to display the songs.
    5. Update the main page to include the songs component.
    6. Run the application.
    ```

- This method is particularly useful where you don't know the exact steps and you can even take plan created by Copilot and modify it to fit your exact requirements.
